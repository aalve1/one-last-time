<h1>Photography</h1>
	<body>
	During senior year of high school, I began to have a passion for photography. I don't have enough money for a professional camera, but my friend's mom gifted me a Polaroid camera for Christmas and I decided to put it to good use. There was a school trip to Albania (and a few other countries such as Greece and Croatia)	during spring break and I was lucky enough to go. I took a bunch of polaroids of where we went, and I also took some pictures on my phone. I guess since that trip, I've always been taking pictures wherever I go. Some of the pictures below are from the trip.
